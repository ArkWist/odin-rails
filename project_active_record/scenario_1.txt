# Scenario 2

## Description

You are building the profile tab for a new user on your site. You are already storing your user's username and email, but now you want to collect demographic information like city, state, country, age and gender. Think -- how many profiles should a user have? How would you relate this to the User model?

## Solution

>> **User**
>> 
>> id:         integer
>> created_at: datetime
>> updated_at: datetime
>> username:   string [unique, 4-15 chars, present]
>> email:      string [unique, present]
>> 
>> has_one profile

>> **Profile**
>> 
>> id: integer
>> created_at: datetime
>> updated_at: datetme
>> city:       string
>> state:      string
>> country:    string
>> age:        integer
>> gender:     string
>> 
>> belongs_to user
